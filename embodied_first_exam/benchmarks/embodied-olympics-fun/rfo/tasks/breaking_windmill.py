"""Breaking windmill: the power move of breaking (WDSF Breaking, the Olympic programme of Paris 2024): from a stand, go
down to the floor and do consecutive windmills, the body rolling over the upper back, the shoulders and the chest
while the legs, held apart, circle round above the floor.

A windmill revolution is judged on the torso: its long axis (pelvis to neck) turns once round the vertical, and the
torso rolls once about that axis (back, shoulder, chest, shoulder, back on the floor), both the same way round; the
turning is counted only while the body lies on the floor: the long axis near horizontal and the pelvis low (a
heading of a near-vertical axis is ill-defined: a small wobble in a headstand or handstand would sweep through 360
degrees of it). During the set only the torso, the arms and the hands may touch the floor (the shoulders and the
upper back are the torso and the upper arms); the hips and the legs may not; in each half revolution the back, chest
or shoulders (the torso or an upper arm) must touch the floor. The G1's head is fixed to its torso (no neck joint)
and its back face lies 7 mm inside the torso's: on the upper back the head brushes the floor, so a head touch is
allowed, but it is not the back's touch (a head spin is not a windmill).

Robot: the G1 (33 kg, 1.32 m), the lighter and shorter body: a windmill is driven by the swing of the legs (88 N m
hips) round a body lying on its shoulders; the H1-2 has twice the mass and a waist of one joint."""
