"""Double Dutch: two ropes turned in opposite directions by two automatic rope turners; the robot enters the turning
ropes and jumps them, one rope per jump, a number of times in a row without the ropes ever touching it.

Everything that moves is physical. Each turner is a post with two motor-driven cranks (its two hands), the way
automatic rope-turning machines work: a crank arm on an axle, a geared motor with a torque limit, the rope tied to
the crank pin by a swivel. Each rope is a chain of 24 capsules (a swivel, then universal joints: they bend, the
rope does not twist against itself) with the rope's real mass and the air's drag. At
t = 0 the ropes are already turning: their state is that of the same machines and ropes turned for a few seconds
from rest (computed once per process in a model of the floor, the turners and the ropes alone)."""

# Shared block (v2): physical rope turners and a physical rope, the same code in each family module that uses
# them (a task directory holds one module). Needs: math,
# xml.etree.ElementTree as ET, numpy as np, mujoco.
#
# A turner's hand is a motor-driven crank, the way automatic rope-turning machines work: a crank arm on a horizontal
# axle on a post, driven by a geared motor; the rope's end hangs from the crank pin on a swivel (a ball joint: the
# rope may twist and swing about it freely). The arm meets the robot (contype 64, conaffinity 4 | 8), not the rope
# tied to it nor the floor. The motor is a position servo with a torque limit (MuJoCo `position` actuator: kp, kv,
# forcerange), the axle damped by the motor's back-EMF (crank_xml's damping): its controller follows a steady
# angle ramp (TurnerDrive.angle), so the hands at the two ends of a rope stay in phase, as on a machine with a common
# drive; a rope caught on a body loads the motor, which stalls at its torque limit and the crank lags (the robot is
# pulled, the rope stops on it).
#
# The rope: N segments (capsules) in two chains, one hanging from each crank's pin (the swivel there is the chain's
# first joint), the two halves joined mid-rope by a `connect` (a loop closed between two like segments, not at a
# pin against a crank's inertia, where the 5 g end segment's tie diverged when a robot leaned on the rope); free to
# bend (a cord has almost no bending stiffness), each segment with the rope's mass for its length and a solid
# cylinder's inertia. Between segments the joint is a universal joint (two hinges across the rope), not a ball joint:
# a cord's torsional stiffness is large against a 15 cm segment's twist inertia, so its segments do not twist against
# each other (with ball joints a robot's hip rubbing the rope spun single segments about their own axis to 380
# rad/s and the chain diverged, stress test). The mid-rope `connect` holds as the rope does: solimp 0.99
# 0.999 (with MuJoCo's default impedance, whose force scales with the few grams of a segment, a robot leaning on
# the rope pulled the tie 4 m apart). The air: RopeDrag applies quadratic drag on each segment as a force, the drag of
# a cylinder in cross flow (C_d 1.2 on the flow across the segment, the air's density 1.225 kg/m^3), every physics
# step. A family using it builds its venue without MuJoCo's fluid model (Scene option density 0): with it on, the
# implicit integrator's fluid derivatives over the deep rope chains cost 7 to 9 times the step (measured: 1.4 ms
# against 0.19 ms per physics step for two 24-segment ropes) and the real-time twin would fall below 1.5 times real
