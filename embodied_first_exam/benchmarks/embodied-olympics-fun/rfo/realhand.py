"""The real hands: holding objects by contact and friction only (no weld: what a hand holds can slip, twist and drop).
Opt-in per side from a family's build():

    sc.real_hands["left"] = "dex3"             # the G1 only: Unitree's Dex3-1 three-finger hand (FINGER HANDS, below)

The kinds of one world may differ per side; a side without one keeps its palm pad (or fist) bit for bit.

THE DEX1-1. Unitree's Dex1-1 two-finger parallel gripper on a wrist mount.
The Dex1-1 (https://www.unitree.com/Dex1-1, product page 2026-10): 143 x 78 x 67 mm, 0.55 kg; stroke 90 mm; jaw length
80 mm; grip force 5-120 N (adjustable); speed 50-375 mm/s; full-stroke close 0.24 s; width 78 mm half open, 120 mm
fully open; friction-grasp load 5 kg; sold for the G1, the H2 and the R1 (not for the H1 / H1-2: on the H1-2 it is a
deviation, mounted where the Inspire hand's palm ends, on the same wrist mount as every other hand tool).

The model, in the wrist mount's frame (+z along the forearm away from the wrist; +x the palm's normal):
  housing   a box 78 (x) x 67 (y) x 63 (z) mm from the mount's origin outwards, 0.43 kg
  jaws      two fingers 80 mm long (z, from 63 to 143 mm), 15 mm thick (x), 34 mm wide (y), 0.06 kg each, on slide
            joints along x: jaw "a" on the palm side (+x), jaw "b" on the back of the hand (-x); the opening between
            their pads is 90 mm open, 0 closed; an equality couples the two (the rack and pinion: one DoF)
  pads      the inner face of each jaw is a rubber pad of 3 x 2 overlapping segments (2 mm proud, 80 x 34 mm in all) so
            a handle gets a contact patch, not one point: friction 1.0, torsional friction 5 mm (condim 4), priority 2
            (the pad's contact parameters win over the held object's), stiff (solref 0.004 1, solimp 0.99 0.999)
  friction  a world with a real hand gets elliptic friction cones and impratio 100 (unless the family set them): MuJoCo's
            friction is soft, and with its defaults a clamped handle creeps under a steady torque (IMPRATIO)
  centre    a site `<side>_jaw_centre` (also the hand's palm site) midway between the pads and along them, mount axes
The housing and the jaws are part `<side>_hand` for the referee, contype 4 / conaffinity 0 like the body's hulls (they
touch every prop, contype 1 / conaffinity 13 or 5, not the robot itself), plus explicit pairs with the hulls of the
rest of the body (the other arm, the trunk, the legs) like a hand tool, and between two grippers.

The controller (each 1 ms physics step; RAW_DIM unchanged): the sim row's `grip_<side>` is the closure command c in
[0, 1] (clipped): the commanded opening is 90 mm x (1 - c). A setpoint per jaw moves towards 45 mm x c at most
187.5 mm/s (the opening at 375 mm/s: full stroke in 0.24 s), and each jaw is a force-limited PD servo on it:
force = clip(KP (setpoint - q) - KV dq, -120 N, 120 N), KP = 20 000 N/m, KV = 80 N s/m. A command that opens starts
from where the jaws are (the setpoint of a clamp, which ran on past the object, comes back to the jaws at once): a
clamp eases or lets go within a physics step, then the jaws open at the speed limit. On an object the jaws stop on,
the clamp force is therefore min(120 N, 10 N per mm that the commanded opening is below the object's width): a fully
closed command (c = 1) clamps anything wider than 12 mm at the full 120 N; a command a few mm under the width clamps
lightly (and the object slips).

What the hand holds (`World.held[side]`): the body that touches both jaws now (by contact, at every physics step);
None otherwise. A family puts an object between the open jaws at reset and calls `w.close_on(side, name)`.

The speed limit is the setpoint's: the jaws themselves follow it a little faster when nothing holds them (about
0.39 m/s opening freely) and, for a few milliseconds, up to about 0.45 m/s when a clamp springs open (the pads'
stored compression).

Deviations from the device: one closure command per hand (the real one also takes a speed and a force setting: here
the speed is the maximum and the force follows from the commanded opening); no 5 N minimum force; two pads at
friction 1.0 and 120 N hold about 240 N of shear, some five times the device's rated 5 kg friction-grasp load; the
drive's inertia (ARMATURE) is an estimate; the gripper's 0.55 kg comes on top of the wrist link's own mass, which
keeps the hand it replaces (the G1's rubber fist: only its mesh goes; the H1-2's Inspire hand: its finger bodies,
about 0.05 kg per hand, go, its palm stays); on the H1-2 (for which Unitree does not sell it) the gripper sits where
the Inspire palm ends, which makes that forearm longer than a real installation would.

# ================================================================================================ FINGER HANDS
# Two real multi-finger hands, each its robot's own, holding by the contact and friction of their fingers, thumb and
# palm (no weld). The agent's grip column of that side is one closure command c in [0, 1] (clipped) for the whole hand,
# through a synergy (as the makers' own drivers close a hand with one command): every drive's target is
# open + c x (closed - open). A family may set the synergy's closed pose per drive (real_hand_options "closed").
#
# THE DEX3-1 ("dex3", the G1). Unitree's three-finger hand (https://www.unitree.com/Dex3-1, product page 2026-10):
# 0.71 kg; 175 x 88 x 77 mm (flat); 7 joints: thumb 3 (0: -60..60 deg, 1: -35..60, 2: 0..100), index 2 and middle 2
# (0: 0..90, 1: 0..100); "6 motors drive directly, 1 motor drive with gears": joint motors F-1515-108 and F-1515-214,
# maximum actual torque with the torque in the direction of the speed 0.49 / 0.86 N m, against it (back-driven)
# 1.37 / 3.1 N m, speed 23 / 11 rad/s; rated grasp 0.5 kg (a 5 cm hard ball, palm down). The geared joint is taken to
# be the thumb's rotation (thumb 0; Menagerie gives it the larger torque limit, 2.45 N m against 1.4); the six
# others are direct (F-1515-108). The model is MuJoCo Menagerie's unitree_g1/g1_with_hands.xml (BSD-3-Clause, from
# Unitree's g1 URDF): its link frames, joint axes and ranges, link masses and inertias; its meshes (decimated to about
# 250 faces a link, 1100 the palm: DEX3_MESH at the end of this file; the right hand's are the left's mirrored) are the
# visual and the collision shapes (each a convex hull, as Menagerie collides them; thumb 1 a box, as Menagerie's).
# The palm takes the rest of the 0.71 kg (0.386 kg, a box's inertia). Written in Menagerie's wrist_yaw_link frame (the
# G1's here: x along the hand, the left palm facing -y, the right +y), placed under the wrist mount by the inverse of
# the mount's pose; the rubber fist it replaces goes (its mass stays in the wrist link: about 0.1 kg, not separable).
#
# THE INSPIRE RH56DFX ("inspire", the H1-2). The H1-2's own five-finger hand (Inspire Robots RH56DFX: 6 DoF, 12
# joints, 6 linear servo drives, self-locking; fingertip force 10 N per finger, 15 N the thumb, here 2 x that: H2-class,
# INSPIRE_TIP_N; four-finger flexion
# 260 deg/s, thumb rotation 107 deg/s, thumb flexion 70 deg/s, closing 0.8 s; 540 g; passive load 8 kg per finger;
# the maker's listing via Knoxlabs, 2026-10). The H1-2's model already carries its finger links (Unitree unitree_rl_gym
# h1_2.xml, commit 276801e, and unitree_ros h1_2.urdf: their frames, meshes, masses, inertias), fixed there: here they
# get Unitree's own joints (axes, ranges) and the URDF's couplings (the mimic joints: each finger's intermediate =
# 1.0 x its proximal; the thumb's intermediate = 1.6 x, its distal = 2.4 x its pitch), the couplings as joint
# equalities; each finger link collides as its mesh's convex hull, the palm as the hand base's (the robot model's own
# collision geom). The thumb's pitch drive is held to 0..0.5 rad (0.5 x 1.6 and x 2.4 are its two couplings' limits).
#
# THE DRIVE (both). Each drive is a joint servo on a setpoint (the motor's position): the setpoint moves towards its
# target at the drive's speed limit, but closing it stops where the servo would push harder than the drive's ACTIVE
# limit (a motor stalls at its rated torque); the joint follows by torque = clip(kp (setpoint - q) + kd (setpoint
# speed - dq), -PASSIVE, PASSIVE), computed at every 1 ms physics step; a load beyond the PASSIVE limit (back-driving
# the gear: Dex3-1's 1.37 / 3.1 N m; the Inspire's self-locking screw: its 8 kg passive load) drags the setpoint
# with the joint (the drive slips). So a closed hand squeezes with the active limit, and holds against a load up to
# the passive one. Inspire forces are fingertip forces: the drive's torque is that force times the fingertip's lever
# (INSPIRE_LEVER, the fingertip's speed per drive speed at half closure, measured on this model).
#
# THE GRIP-FORCE FACTOR (a family's declared deviation): real_hand_options[side]["grip_scale"] = k (default 1.0)
# multiplies the drives' active and passive limits, kp and kd (a stronger drive of the same speed), as the motor-scale
# block does for the body's motors; robot_facts report the scaled values and k.
#
# What a hand holds (World.held[side]): a movable body (under a free joint) that touches its fingers and its thumb or
# palm now (by contact, at every physics step). The pads: the finger links and the palm collide with friction 1.0
# (rubber pads; the Dex1-1's), torsional 5 mm (condim 4), priority 2 (their contact parameters win), stiff (the
# Dex1-1 pads' solref / solimp); the robot model's palm hull (the Inspire's) keeps the robot's own contact.
# Collision: the hand's geoms are part `<side>_hand` (contype 4, conaffinity 0: every prop, not the robot), plus
# explicit pairs with the rest of the body's hulls (like a hand tool), between the two hands, and the thumb with the
# fingers. Grasp frame (grasp_frame): a site `<side>_grasp`, where a handle's axis sits in a closed power grasp:
# columns x out of the palm, z along the fingers, y = z x x (the left hand: towards the little finger, the right:
# towards the index finger).
