| Oracle | `none` — no reference solution; the referee is tested: positive by injection (a straight fist handstand placed with the chest facing +x, hand support with real contacts for 0.05 s, then 2.6 m/s up and 4.1 rad/s about the left-right axis: it flies, turns upright and lands on both feet facing -x, 0.64 s from the feet leaving the floor to the landing; the rotation removed at touchdown, the walk at zero command stands it). The round-off is one element through the handstand, not a held handstand (FIG CoP): the hand support, the landing and the hands after it are judged every 1 ms; a foot counts as down until it has been off for more than 0.03 s, the second foot within 0.10 s of the first; the first foot must be down at most 0.70 s after the feet left the floor for the hand support. Negatives: nop, landing facing +x (a tinsica), sideways, one foot then the other, hands down at the landing, a jumped half-turn without hands, a crouch hop on the hands (not inverted), a landing that falls, outside the area, 0.8 s on the hands (a held handstand); a model run's kick-up handstand held about 2 s, then a step down, one foot 0.15 s before the other, fails: 'not a round-off: the hand support lasted too long' at 4.34 s. Every rule above is judged in the family's own 1 ms substep hook.; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §2.7) |

## Task
Do a round-off: go from your feet onto your hands, turn half round through the handstand and come down onto both feet together facing back the way you came, then stand. (Embodied Olympics `round-off`; the robot as a service: its head cameras, joint sensors and IMUs, and the venue's fixed camera only.)

## Difficulty
The round-off passes your whole weight over two small fists while the body turns half round in the air above them, and ends in a two-foot landing that must stop the rotation: there is no built-in action for any of it and the arms' motors give 25 N m. In standard mode the agent has no simulator and no state: it sees through the robot's cameras, acts through the client, and has 5 resets (only the last attempt is graded).

## Reference solution
None (as `embodied-olympics-fun-round-off-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
The sim sidecar's referee judges the live attempt, and that is the verdict (`final.json`: `graded_by` live, `replays` 0;
no grading replay, owner 2026-10-17); the frozen start is checked on the live simulator (`instance_mismatch`:
infrastructure), and the video is rendered from the recorded attempt afterwards. `/tests/grade.py` reads
`/data/final.json`: pass iff the live attempt succeeded. The
rules: You face +x at the start. The hand support counts when only your hands touch the floor and your torso is upside down, its long axis (from the pelvis up to the neck) within 45.0 degrees of pointing straight down. After it, the landing: your feet come down with no hand on the floor, the second foot within 0.1 s of the first (both feet together; a foot off the floor again for more than 0.03 s before the other is down starts the landing over), the first foot down at most 0.7 s after your feet left the floor for the hand support (one continuous motion, not a held handstand), and when both feet are down your pelvis and your torso face back, -x, each within 45.0 degrees (landing facing +x or sideways is a cartwheel or a Tinsica, not a round-off). Then you stand for 1.0 s without a break: only your feet on the floor, your torso within 20.0 degrees of vertical, your pelvis slower than 0.35 m/s. You fail if any part of you other than your hands and feet touches the floor or your pelvis is lower than 0.25 m (a fall); if after the hand support one foot lands and the other does not follow within 0.1 s, or no foot is down 0.7 s after your feet left the floor, or a hand is on the floor when both feet are down, or you land not facing back; if a hand touches the floor after the landing; if any part of you touches the floor outside the 12.0 m x 12.0 m floor area; or after 30 s. Before the hand support anything is free (steps, a hop, a hurdle). No oracle; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §2.7).

## Compute resources
Minimum allocation for one trial (docs/protocol/README.md §2.9; `[metadata.resources]` in `task.toml`). The agent phase counts every container of the trial at once (the agent's, and in standard modes the simulator sidecar); the verifier phase runs after it.

| | Agent phase | Verifier |
|---|---|---|
| CPU cores | 3 | 2 |
| Memory | 5 GB | 3 GB |
| GPU memory | 0 GB | 0 GB |

- GPU: not needed.
- Measured: author estimate (an RTX 4090 workstation, 2026-10-11): CPU-only; the sim sidecar steps and renders on one or two cores (under 1 GB), the agent's container holds the harness and the client
- Limits in the agent phase (docs/protocol/README.md §2.10; `[metadata.resources.limits]`, shown to the agent in `instruction.md`; always measured and reported, and exceeding one fails the trial only when the run sets `RCB_LIMITS_ENFORCE=1`), the agent's container: no GPU, 8 GiB memory, 512 processes, 20 GiB of new files under `/app`, `/tmp`, `/root`; 60 s within 120 s. Expected peak of the whole trial: 0 GiB GPU memory, 16 GiB memory. Limits measured: author estimate: no trials yet; the agent's container 8 GiB under its 10 GiB cap; whole trial: + the sim service's 8 GiB cap; disk 20 GiB for downloaded tools and controllers; processes 512: design default.

The Code sets no time, so here the hand support, from the moment the feet leave the floor before it to the first foot's touchdown of the landing, may last at most 0.7 s (the number is this benchmark's: a gymnast's round-off spends a few tenths of a second on the hands; the G1 falling from a straight handstand, its feet over its hands, needs about 0.6 s to reach the floor with its feet); a kick-up to a handstand and a step down is not a round-off · a round-off is judged pass or fail, as one element without a run-up requirement or judges: hand support with the torso within 45.0 degrees of upside down, a two-foot landing facing back within 45.0 degrees, and a stand; height, speed and form are not scored |
