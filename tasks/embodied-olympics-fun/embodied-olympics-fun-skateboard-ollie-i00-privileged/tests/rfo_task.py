"""Skateboard ollie, stationary: a rider stands on a real skateboard at rest on flat ground (a free deck with
kicktails, two steering trucks, four wheels on axles; nothing holds the feet to it) and ollies: the back foot snaps the
tail against the ground, the front foot drags the board up, the whole board rises clear of the ground, and the robot
lands on it with all four wheels down and stands still on it.

Sources of the board's numbers: Element Section 7.5 deck (31.5 x 7.5 in, wheelbase 14.0 in); a maple deck of 3 lb
(maple decks 3-4.5 lb, parcelpath.com); Independent 129 Stage 11 truck, 367 g (evo.com; 331 g at skatedeluxe), 7.625 in
axle, about 55 mm high; Spitfire Formula Four 52 mm 99A wheels, 240 g the set (skatedeluxe) plus two 12 g bearings
each; the trucks' pivot axis at 63 degrees and the bushings' tilt stiffness of 100 N m/rad (Varszegi and Takacs,
"Downhill motion of the skater-skateboard system", Periodica Polytechnica Mech. Eng. 60(1), 2016, Table 1); the
tail-ground impact with a coefficient of restitution of 0.8 (Heinen, Brockie, ten Broek, van der Kruk, Moore,
"Maximizing ollie height by optimizing control strategy and skateboard geometry using direct collocation", Sports
Engineering 2023); wood on concrete, friction 0.6 (Engineering ToolBox); a hard (99A) urethane wheel on smooth
concrete: rolling resistance 0.02 (non-pneumatic wheels on concrete 0.020, Dickey, RESNA 2018; hard 95A urethane
casters 0.025-0.035), sliding friction 0.7; grip tape on a shoe sole, friction 1.0."""
