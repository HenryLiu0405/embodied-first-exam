class Keeper:
    """A goalkeeper dummy as a physical mechanism (no pose or velocity is ever written after reset).

    A rigid board (WIDTH x HEIGHT x DEPTH, MASS) on a carriage that runs on a straight rail along the goal line: a slide
    joint (axis y) with hard end stops at +-rail_half (the rail's buffers; they keep the board between the posts). A
    linear servo motor drives the carriage: one PD force on a setpoint, F = KP (s - y) + KV (s' - y') + MASS s'',
    saturated at +-F_MAX (MuJoCo's forcerange). The only thing a family scripts is the setpoint s: it moves on a trapezoidal profile
    (|s'| <= V_MAX, |s''| <= A_MAX) towards the commanded target, integrated every 1 ms physics step. A ball that hits
    the board pushes it: the board takes the impulse as an 80 kg free carriage would along the rail, and the servo
    pulls it back with at most F_MAX (the command carries the profile's speed and acceleration as feed-forward:
    ctrl = s + (KV s' + MASS s'') / KP); across the rail (x, z, rotations) the carriage is held by the rail.

    Limits and their sources:
    - MASS 80 kg, 1.9 m x 0.6 m x 0.3 m: the dummy's mass and size (an adult goalkeeper's mass and standing height,
      shoulder width).
    - V_MAX 3.0 m/s: an elite goalkeeper's lateral shuffle and the start of a dive move at about 3 m/s.
    - F_MAX 800 N (about one body weight of the 80 kg dummy, 10 m/s^2): of the order of the peak lateral push-off a
      goalkeeper applies in a dive (about one body weight); an off-the-shelf industrial linear motor of this peak force
      is a common size. A_MAX 9 m/s^2 is the profile's acceleration, inside F_MAX / MASS = 10 m/s^2 so the servo can
      follow it.
    - KP 20 000 N/m, KV 2 500 N s/m: a stiff, critically damped servo for 80 kg (2 sqrt(KP MASS) = 2 530 N s/m); a
      0.04 m tracking error already saturates F_MAX.
    - Rail rolling friction 4 N (a linear-guide rolling coefficient about 0.005 x the 785 N weight)."""
