# The ball machine below is the shared block (VERSION 4), the same in every family module that feeds a ball.
# ===================================================================================== ball machine (shared block)
# A shared block: the same code in each family module that feeds a ball; a task directory holds one module.
#
# A physical ball machine in place of a ball that is pinned and then given a velocity. Real ball machines (tennis:
# Lobster, Spinshot; table tennis: two-wheel robots; baseball / softball: JUGS-type two-wheel pitching machines;
# volleyball and football: two-wheel launchers) throw the ball with two counter-rotating wheels driven by
# speed-controlled, torque-limited motors: the ball, fed from a hopper down a chute, is squeezed in the gap between the
# wheels (the gap is smaller than the ball) and leaves with about the wheels' mean surface speed; a difference between
# the two surface speeds rolls it, which gives the spin (Cross & Lindsey, "Ball machines", in Brody, Cross and Lindsey,
# The Physics and Technology of Tennis, 2002; Ferraresi et al., "Analysis of the throwing mechanism of a two-wheel
# pitching machine", Sports Engineering 2014). Here:
#
#   wheels   two solid discs on hinge joints in a fixed head, each driven by a MuJoCo velocity actuator (a speed loop,
#            gain kv) whose torque is limited to motor_torque_n_m (the motor's); their tread meets the ball in an
#            explicit contact pair: the series compliance of ball and tread (contact_k_n_m per contact, quasi-static,
#            the sources in PRESETS), the pinch's restitution, the tread's friction. The ball's own dynamic contact with
#            the wheels is excluded (the pair replaces it, it does not add to it).
#   aim      the head is fixed in the venue at the pose the launch needs (an operator aims a machine before a drill):
#            its axis L is the launch direction corrected by the calibrated deflection, the wheel pair is turned about
#            L so that the spin's axis is the one asked for (two wheels give spin about an axis across the flight
#            only: a component along the flight, gyro spin, is not made and is reported).
#   feed     the ball lies in the throat, a cradle of two steel rails along the head's axis behind the wheels (in
#            reality the end of the hopper's chute), between a gate in front and the feed ram behind; both are plates
#            on slide joints driven by force-limited position servos (the gate: gate_force_n, the class of a small
#            12 V push-pull solenoid; the ram: about 100 x the ball's weight in newtons, its speed limited by the
#            slide's damping to about 1.5 m/s, as a pneumatic or crank feeder). feed(t): the gate opens, then the
#            ram pushes the ball into the wheels. It works at any elevation from about -30 to +80 degrees (a gravity
#            chute alone cannot feed a ball that has to go up into the wheels). One ball per machine load.
#   dropper  Dropper below: a ball resting on two trapdoor leaves on force-limited slides, opened apart: a drop with
#            neither speed nor spin, by gravity only.
#
# calibration: the wheel surface speeds for a launch come from FIT, a table measured in simulation with this very
# block (calibrate() below; 1 ms steps, implicitfast, elliptic cones, impratio 100, the venue's air) for each preset:
# per mean surface speed V and relative difference q = D / V, the exit speed / V, the spin across the flight and the
# exit's turn towards the faster wheel; and a fitted droop (g0 + g1 cos(elevation) / speed^2, deg). solve() inverts
# the table (bilinear, Newton) and the head is aimed to cancel the turn and the droop. ACCURACY records what launches
# set from the table achieved in the standalone world, and the spread over 8 perturbations (the ball 1 mm off along
# and across the axis, the wheel speeds +-0.5 %). Football and volleyball: speed within 2 % (a slow 4.5 m/s lob: 7 %
# short), direction within 2 deg, spin within 10 %, spread under 0.6 % and 0.9 deg. The small balls are less
# regular: tennis within 2 % and 3 deg; baseball at 15 m/s within 1 %, but at 21 m/s / 45 deg 10 % fast with a
# large spin; table tennis within 2 % in speed but 7-14 deg off in direction (spread 3-4 deg); juggling 4-8 % slow.
# A family measures its own shot in its world and trims the launch it asks for (or the
# wheel speeds (BallMachine(..., rim=(v0, v1), deflect_deg=...)).
#
# Machine, not a person: wherever a family's rule book has a server, a pitcher, a tosser, the machine stands in its
# place (a declared deviation, worded by the family).
