"""Handstand: the floor-exercise handstand held for 2 s (FIG MAG Code of Points 2025-2028, floor element I.19), from a
stand and back to the feet.

Robot: the G1. A handstand puts the whole body weight on the arms. The G1 weighs 33 kg (324 N, 162 N per arm); its
shoulders give 25 N m each, so the body above them (27 kg, its centre about 0.45 m from the shoulder line) may lean at
most 50 / (27 x 9.81 x 0.45) = 0.42 rad off the arms' line before the shoulders give way, and in a straight handstand
the static shoulder torque is close to zero. Its wrists (pitch and yaw 5 N m) cannot hold a flat-hand handstand: with
the wrist bent 90 degrees the pad lies 0.12 to 0.22 m beside the wrist axis, i.e. 160 N x 0.17 m = 27 N m, more than
five times the motor, so the weight would rest on the wrist's mechanical stop and its housing; on the fist (the pad's
end face, 4.4 x 8 cm, the forearm's line through it) the wrist torque is near zero and the pads' 8 cm give a support
the balance can use. The H1-2 (67 kg: 330 N per arm, 40 N m shoulders) has half the G1's torque per kilogram, wrists
that bend 0.47 rad at most and fixed Inspire fingers: the G1 is the robot that can do it."""
