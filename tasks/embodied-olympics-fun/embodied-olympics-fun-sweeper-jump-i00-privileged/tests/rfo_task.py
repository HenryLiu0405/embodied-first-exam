"""Sweeper jump (the "Meltdown" party game): a padded boom on a motor-driven central pivot sweeps round at shin
height; standing on its podium, the robot jumps over it each time it comes round, a number of times in a row,
without being hit, and ends standing.

The machine is physical: the boom is a body on a vertical hinge at the motion base, driven by a speed-controlled,
torque-limited motor (MuJoCo `velocity` actuator with a force range: the variable-frequency drive's speed loop and
its rated torque). Nothing writes its pose or velocity after t = 0; at t = 0 it is already turning at the set speed
(the start state). A hit really pushes the robot (up to the motor's torque) and the boom really slows under the load.
