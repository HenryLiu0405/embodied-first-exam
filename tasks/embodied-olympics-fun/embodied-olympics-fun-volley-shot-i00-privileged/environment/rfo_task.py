    """A goalkeeper dummy as a physical mechanism (no pose or velocity is ever written after reset).

    A rigid board (WIDTH x HEIGHT x DEPTH, MASS) on a carriage that runs on a straight rail along the goal line: a slide
    joint (axis y) with hard end stops at +-rail_half (the rail's buffers; they keep the board between the posts). A
    linear servo motor drives the carriage: one PD force on a setpoint, F = KP (s - y) + KV (s' - y') + MASS s'',
    saturated at +-F_MAX (MuJoCo's forcerange). The only thing a family scripts is the setpoint s: it moves on a trapezoidal profile
    (|s'| <= V_MAX, |s''| <= A_MAX) towards the commanded target, integrated every 1 ms physics step. A ball that hits
    the board pushes it: the board takes the impulse as an 80 kg free carriage would along the rail, and the servo
    pulls it back with at most F_MAX (the command carries the profile's speed and acceleration as feed-forward:
    ctrl = s + (KV s' + MASS s'') / KP); across the rail (x, z, rotations) the carriage is held by the rail.

    Limits and their sources:
    - MASS 80 kg, 1.9 m x 0.6 m x 0.3 m: the dummy's mass and size (an adult goalkeeper's mass and standing height,
      shoulder width).
    - V_MAX 3.0 m/s: an elite goalkeeper's lateral shuffle and the start of a dive move at about 3 m/s.
    - F_MAX 800 N (about one body weight of the 80 kg dummy, 10 m/s^2): of the order of the peak lateral push-off a
      goalkeeper applies in a dive (about one body weight); an off-the-shelf industrial linear motor of this peak force
      is a common size. A_MAX 9 m/s^2 is the profile's acceleration, inside F_MAX / MASS = 10 m/s^2 so the servo can
      follow it.
    - KP 20 000 N/m, KV 2 500 N s/m: a stiff, critically damped servo for 80 kg (2 sqrt(KP MASS) = 2 530 N s/m); a
      0.04 m tracking error already saturates F_MAX.
    - Rail rolling friction 4 N (a linear-guide rolling coefficient about 0.005 x the 785 N weight)."""

# >>> shared block "ball machine" (VERSION 4, the same in every family module that feeds a ball)
# ===================================================================================== ball machine (shared block)
# A shared block: the same code in each family module that feeds a ball; a task directory holds one module.
#
# A physical ball machine in place of a ball that is pinned and then given a velocity. Real ball machines (tennis:
# Lobster, Spinshot; table tennis: two-wheel robots; baseball / softball: JUGS-type two-wheel pitching machines;
# volleyball and football: two-wheel launchers) throw the ball with two counter-rotating wheels driven by
# speed-controlled, torque-limited motors: the ball, fed from a hopper down a chute, is squeezed in the gap between the
# wheels (the gap is smaller than the ball) and leaves with about the wheels' mean surface speed; a difference between
# the two surface speeds rolls it, which gives the spin (Cross & Lindsey, "Ball machines", in Brody, Cross and Lindsey,
# The Physics and Technology of Tennis, 2002; Ferraresi et al., "Analysis of the throwing mechanism of a two-wheel
# pitching machine", Sports Engineering 2014). Here:
#
#   wheels   two solid discs on hinge joints in a fixed head, each driven by a MuJoCo velocity actuator (a speed loop,
#            gain kv) whose torque is limited to motor_torque_n_m (the motor's); their tread meets the ball in an
#            explicit contact pair: the series compliance of ball and tread (contact_k_n_m per contact, quasi-static,
#            the sources in PRESETS), the pinch's restitution, the tread's friction. The ball's own dynamic contact with
#            the wheels is excluded (the pair replaces it, it does not add to it).
#   aim      the head is fixed in the venue at the pose the launch needs (an operator aims a machine before a drill):
#            its axis L is the launch direction corrected by the calibrated deflection, the wheel pair is turned about
#            L so that the spin's axis is the one asked for (two wheels give spin about an axis across the flight
#            only: a component along the flight, gyro spin, is not made and is reported).
#   feed     the ball lies in the throat, a cradle of two steel rails along the head's axis behind the wheels (in
#            reality the end of the hopper's chute), between a gate in front and the feed ram behind; both are plates
#            on slide joints driven by force-limited position servos (the gate: gate_force_n, the class of a small
#            12 V push-pull solenoid; the ram: about 100 x the ball's weight in newtons, its speed limited by the
#            slide's damping to about 1.5 m/s, as a pneumatic or crank feeder). feed(t): the gate opens, then the
#            ram pushes the ball into the wheels. It works at any elevation from about -30 to +80 degrees (a gravity
#            chute alone cannot feed a ball that has to go up into the wheels). One ball per machine load.
#   dropper  Dropper below: a ball resting on two trapdoor leaves on force-limited slides, opened apart: a drop with
#            neither speed nor spin, by gravity only.
#
# calibration: the wheel surface speeds for a launch come from FIT, a table measured in simulation with this very
# block (calibrate() below; 1 ms steps, implicitfast, elliptic cones, impratio 100, the venue's air) for each preset:
# per mean surface speed V and relative difference q = D / V, the exit speed / V, the spin across the flight and the
# exit's turn towards the faster wheel; and a fitted droop (g0 + g1 cos(elevation) / speed^2, deg). solve() inverts
# the table (bilinear, Newton) and the head is aimed to cancel the turn and the droop. ACCURACY records what launches
# set from the table achieved in the standalone world, and the spread over 8 perturbations (the ball 1 mm off along
# and across the axis, the wheel speeds +-0.5 %). Football and volleyball: speed within 2 % (a slow 4.5 m/s lob: 7 %
# short), direction within 2 deg, spin within 10 %, spread under 0.6 % and 0.9 deg. The small balls are less
# regular: tennis within 2 % and 3 deg; baseball at 15 m/s within 1 %, but at 21 m/s / 45 deg 10 % fast with a
# large spin; table tennis within 2 % in speed but 7-14 deg off in direction (spread 3-4 deg); juggling 4-8 % slow.
# A family measures its own shot in its world and trims the launch it asks for (or the
# wheel speeds (BallMachine(..., rim=(v0, v1), deflect_deg=...)).
#
# Machine, not a person: wherever a family's rule book has a server, a pitcher, a tosser, the machine stands in its
# place (a declared deviation, worded by the family).
