| Oracle | `none` — no reference solution; the referee is tested: positive by injection (a real ankle and hip balance controller holds the robot on the resting board, and at t = 1.2 s one upward velocity of 1.25 m/s is written to the robot's floating base and to the board's; the 6.2 cm clearance, the landing and the 1 s stand are physics under the same controller), for a stationary ollie (the board at rest; clear 5 cm, land on four wheels with both feet, stand still 1 s). No real ollie: 5291 scripted stationary ollies (IK pop, drag, level and land; parameter searches) cleared 5 cm in 565 runs (the board up to about 0.9 m), but only 6 landed and none stood 1 s; of 4810 rolling attempts none rode away; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §2.7) |

## Task
Ollie the skateboard from a standstill: pop the tail, take the board up with your feet until all of it is at least 0.05 m off the ground, land on it and stand still on it for 1.0 s. (Embodied Olympics `skateboard-ollie`; the robot as a service: its head cameras, joint sensors and IMUs, and the venue's fixed camera only.)

## Difficulty
The ollie is a timed whole-body skill on a free board: the tail has to be snapped down with the front foot unloaded, the front foot has to drag the rising board up and level it while the robot is in the air, and the robot has to land on a narrow deck that rolls and steers when it tilts. Even standing still, the board is unstable under a rigid rider (its trucks tilt and steer), so the ankles have to balance it before and after the trick. In standard mode the agent has no simulator and no state: it sees through the robot's cameras, acts through the client, and has 5 resets (only the last attempt is graded).

## Reference solution
None (as `embodied-olympics-fun-skateboard-ollie-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
The sim sidecar's referee judges the live attempt, and that is the verdict (`final.json`: `graded_by` live, `replays` 0;
no grading replay, owner 2026-10-17); the frozen start is checked on the live simulator (`instance_mismatch`:
infrastructure), and the video is rendered from the recorded attempt afterwards. `/tests/grade.py` reads
`/data/final.json`: pass iff the live attempt succeeded. The
rules: The skateboard: a 0.8 m deck, 0.19 m wide, with a kicktail and a nose turned up 18.0 degrees, on two trucks 0.356 m apart with four 0.026 m-radius wheels; the trucks steer when the deck tilts (pivot axis 63.0 degrees, 100.0 N m/rad of bushing stiffness, a stop at 12.0 degrees of tilt). Nothing holds your feet to it: grip tape (friction 1.0) only. The attempt, in this order: (1) pop: the board leaves the ground (no part of it touching anything but you) with a foot on its deck as it leaves; (2) clear: in the same flight of the board, every part of it (deck, trucks, wheels) is at least 0.05 m above the ground; (3) landed: then all four wheels on the ground (each within 0.005 m of it) with both feet on the deck; (4) stand: for 1.0 s without a break, both feet on the deck (contact breaks of at most 0.05 s), all four wheels on the ground, your torso within about 37 degrees of upright (the cosine of its tilt at least 0.8) and your pelvis slower than 0.35 m/s. You succeed at (4). A pop that does not clear may be followed by another. You fail if any part of you other than the feet and shins touches the board (an ollie is done without hands), if any part of you, a foot included, touches the ground or your pelvis drops below 0.3 m (a bail), if the board touches the ground upside down, after the landing if a foot stays off the deck for more than 0.2 s or your torso tilts beyond that limit, and at 8 s. No oracle; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §2.7).

## Compute resources
Minimum allocation for one trial (docs/protocol/README.md §2.9; `[metadata.resources]` in `task.toml`). The agent phase counts every container of the trial at once (the agent's, and in standard modes the simulator sidecar); the verifier phase runs after it.

| | Agent phase | Verifier |
|---|---|---|
| CPU cores | 3 | 2 |
| Memory | 5 GB | 3 GB |
| GPU memory | 0 GB | 0 GB |

- GPU: not needed.
- Measured: author estimate (an RTX 4090 workstation, 2026-10-11): CPU-only; the sim sidecar steps and renders on one or two cores (under 1 GB), the agent's container holds the harness and the client
- Limits in the agent phase (docs/protocol/README.md §2.10; `[metadata.resources.limits]`, shown to the agent in `instruction.md`; always measured and reported, and exceeding one fails the trial only when the run sets `RCB_LIMITS_ENFORCE=1`), the agent's container: no GPU, 8 GiB memory, 512 processes, 20 GiB of new files under `/app`, `/tmp`, `/root`; 60 s within 120 s. Expected peak of the whole trial: 0 GiB GPU memory, 16 GiB memory. Limits measured: author estimate: no trials yet; the agent's container 8 GiB under its 10 GiB cap; whole trial: + the sim service's 8 GiB cap; disk 20 GiB for downloaded tools and controllers; processes 512: design default.
