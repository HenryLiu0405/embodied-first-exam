"""Inline speed slalom (World Skate Inline Freestyle, Speed Slalom): from the start box, 12 m of run-up, then on one
foot through a line of 20 cones 0.8 m apart, and over the end line 0.8 m beyond the last cone, against the clock,
+0.2 s for each kicked cone or missed interval.

The skates are real: a rigid boot on each foot (it holds the foot as a laced boot does: a weld of the boot to the
foot's link, the boot's collisions with that foot switched off), an aluminium frame, four urethane wheels in a line,
each on its own axle (a hinge joint, free to spin). Lateral grip, rolling and sliding are the wheels' friction on the
floor, so pushing, gliding and turning are physical. Sources: the skate is FR Skates' AXS junior skate in sizes 29-32
(a 192 mm aluminium frame, 64 mm outer and 62 mm inner wheels; the robot's foot is 0.19 m long); wheels 24 mm wide, 65 g with
bearings, the skate 1.0 kg (estimates: a 64 mm 85A wheel with its bearings, a junior skate); rolling resistance from
Giorgi, "Drag and friction coefficients in roller skating, an indirect determination" (ISBS 1998): F = k m v with
k = 0.0137 1/s, about 0.004 of the weight at 3 m/s; urethane on a smooth concrete sports floor: sliding friction 0.8.
The cones are World Skate's (3.10.1: 7.6-8.0 cm high, base 7.2-7.5 cm, top 2.4-2.7 cm), hard plastic cups of about 20 g
(an estimate), friction 0.4 on the floor."""
